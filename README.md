The website itself isn't too hard to navigae and is as user friendly as possible. If you've never been here,start by creting an account and then singning in. Once you're logged in, you'll notice that the home page is a bit empty at first. That's because you haven't added anything to your profile yet. You'll want to go to the Create Post section in the navbar and input your first entry. You'll then be able to see, udpdate, and delete your posts as you see fit.
